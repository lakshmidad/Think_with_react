## Challenge: Your First React Component
Welcome to your first React experience! Let's get started with a simple challenge to get you familiar with how React components work.

### Objective:
Create a basic React component that displays a welcome message and a short description, with specific styling.

## Instructions:
- Open your App.js file: This file is where you'll be writing your React component.
- Create a container: Inside the App function, return a div element with a class name of "app-container".
- Add headings: Within this div, create two headings:
The first heading (<h1>) should display the text "Hello Kalvium".
The second heading (<h2>) should display the text "My first react experience".
- Style your component:
In the App.css file, add styles to ensure the following:
# The headings should be white in color.
# The headings should be center-aligned.

# Optional
Apply any additional styles to the container (app-container) to make the content look nice and clean.
